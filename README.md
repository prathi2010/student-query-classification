Student Query Classification System
 Overview
The Student Query Classification System is a Python-based NLP project that classifies student questions into three categories:
Intent (Explanation, Doubt Clarification, etc.)

Difficulty Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
The system analyzes user input using rule-based keyword detection and produces structured JSON output.
